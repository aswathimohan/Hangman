HUMIDITY = The amount of water vapor in the air

CARBON FOOTPRINT = The total amount of greenhouse gases produced to directly and indirectly support human activities, usually expressed in equivalent tons of carbon dioxide (CO2)

MELTING ICE = A physical process that results in the phase transition of a substance from a solid to a liquid
FOOD WASTE = It occurs at the stages of production, processing, retailing and consumption and goes to the landfill breaks down anaerobically and produces methane

SUSTAINABILITY = The collection of policies and strategies employed by companies to minimize their environmental impact on future generations

WIND = The flow of gases on a large scale

ACIDIFICATION = An ongoing decrease in the pH of the Earth's oceans, caused by the uptake of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere.

AIR POLLUTION = The introduction of particulates, biological molecules, or other harmful materials into Earth's atmosphere, causing diseases, death to humans, damage to other living organisms such as animals and food crops, or the natural or built environment

SNOWFALL = The process of precipitating snow.

LOSING THE LAKE = Because of a drought over the last decade, there is less water flowing into the lake

SURFACE WINDS = The wind blowing near the Earth's surface

SOLAR RADIATION =A radiant energy emitted by the sun, particularly electromagnetic energy

FOREST FIRE = An uncontrolled fire in an area of combustible vegetation that occurs in the countryside area

AEROSOLS = A colloid of fine solid particles or liquid droplets, in air or another gas

EVAPORATION = The process by which water changes from a liquid to a gas or vapor

STREAMFLOW = The flow of water in a stream or river.

SOIL EROSION =  Wearing away of a field's topsoil by the natural physical forces of water and wind

THERMAL EXPANSION =  Tendency of matter to change in shape, area, and volume in response to a change in temperature, through heat transfer.

MOISTURE =  The presence of a liquid, especially water, often in trace amounts
DEFORESTATION = Clearing Earth's forests on a massive scale, often resulting in damage to the quality of the land

ECOTERRORISM =  Acts of violence committed in support of ecological or environmental causes, against persons or their property

BIOSPHERE = The global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships, including their interaction with the elements of the lithosphere, geosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere

BIODIVERSITY =  The variability within species, between species and between ecosystems

PLATE TECTONICS = It causes a change in the ocean currents and in turn generates more heat.
